# What is this learncpp file?
This folder is for all the programs I write while I take learncpp.com's cpp course: https://www.learncpp.com/


# Questions
Q: Do any of these files include example code given on the website:

A: No, all the programs here are ones I've written myself, though some are spinoffs of end of unit quiz problems so that they were a little more engaging for me.

Q: What are the unit projects?

A: The unit projects are programs I write to help myself review all the topics I learned in the unit.

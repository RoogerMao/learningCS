# What is this learncpp file?
This folder is for all the programs I write while I take learncpp.com's cpp course: https://www.learncpp.com/

# Does this include any examples in the course?
No, all the programs here are ones I've written myself, though some are spinoffs of end of unit quiz problems so that they were a little more engaging for me.

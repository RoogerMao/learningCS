Files I created while I learned to program

# Questions
Q: Many of my c++ files in my compCS repo have more advanced code / code topics in them than the topics currently in here. If I already know these topics, why am I bothering to write programs for simpler topics? 
I'm doing so because I don't think my current understanding of c++ is solid, I'd like to go back to the basics and review them to establish a good foundation.
